          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed ">
            As a full stack developer with a background in rhetorical writing, I
            have a unique perspective that allows me to investigate complex
            problems and create meaningful solutions through software
            development. My proficiency in JavaScript, React.js, Python, and
            other technologies, combined with my experience in creating full
            stack applications, makes me a valuable asset to any software
            engineering team. I am passionate about using my skills to make a
            difference in people's lives, particularly in the area of mental
            health and empowering disadvantaged communities. With a commitment
            to collaboration, continuous learning, and innovation, I am excited
            to bring my skills and experience to an entry-level software
            engineering role and contribute to meaningful projects that
            positively impact society.
